* Description
  Creational design patterns abstract the instantiation process. They help
  make a system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and
  represented. A class creational pattern uses inheritance to vary the class
  thatâ€™s instantiated, whereas an object creational pattern will delegate
  instantiation to another object.

* Common properties

** They work on the basis of how objects can be created

** They isolate the details of object creation

** Code is independent of the type of object to be created
